# Career Navigator AI - Enhanced Take Test Feature

This update improves the "Take Test" feature in the Career Navigator AI project, enhancing answer evaluation accuracy and adding skill completion tracking.

## Features Added

1. **Improved Answer Validation**
   - Enhanced accuracy in evaluating user answers using fuzzy matching
   - Better handling of case sensitivity and minor variations
   - Improved detection of correct answers when using option letters (A, B, C, D)

2. **Detailed Test Feedback**
   - Comprehensive score reports showing correct and incorrect answers
   - Question-by-question feedback with expected answers
   - Clear pass/fail indicator based on 15/20 score threshold

3. **Skill Completion Tracking**
   - Green checkmark appears on completed milestones
   - Completed skills are visually highlighted in roadmap
   - Completion status persists across sessions

## Installation

1. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Ensure the Taketest app is running:
   ```
   cd C:\Users\haran\OneDrive\Desktop\CAREEr\CAREER_NAVIGATOR_AI\Taketest
   python app.py
   ```

## Usage Flow

1. Open the frontend login page:
   ```
   C:\Users\haran\OneDrive\Desktop\CAREEr\CAREER_NAVIGATOR_AI\frontend\login.html
   ```

2. After login, navigate to the Student page and search for a topic to generate a roadmap.

3. Hover over any milestone title in the roadmap to see the "Take Test" button.

4. Click the "Take Test" button to start a 20-question assessment.

5. Complete the test to receive a score and recommendation:
   - Score >= 15/20: You pass and can proceed to the next topic (milestone gets a green checkmark)
   - Score < 15/20: You should review the topic before proceeding

## Troubleshooting

- If the Taketest app isn't starting, manually run:
  ```
  python C:\Users\haran\OneDrive\Desktop\CAREEr\CAREER_NAVIGATOR_AI\Taketest\app.py
  ```

- If the fuzzywuzzy matching isn't working, ensure you've installed the dependencies:
  ```
  pip install fuzzywuzzy python-Levenshtein
  ```

## Integration with Roadmap Generator

The Skill Assessment Test feature is integrated with the Roadmap Generator through:

1. A hover-triggered "Take Test" button on each roadmap stage
2. A modal dialog for displaying and taking the test
3. Results and recommendations displayed after test completion
